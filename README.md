## About

QalcDroid is an Android GUI for the incredible calculator
[libqalculate](https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate).

## Features

Most features from libqalculate are implemented with the **exception** of:

- Entry completion and hints.
- Calculate-as-you-type mode.
- Calculation history.
- Create/edit functions, variables and units.
- Plotting.

All non-implemented features **may** be implemented in the future.

## Status

This project is perfectly usable as a daily driver: all functions, units,
and variables work as expected.

## Issues or Questions

If you are experiencing an issue or have a feature request, please open up an [issue in Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mike7d7/calculator2/-/issues). When submitting a bug please try to be as specific as possible, and try to find a way to reproduce the issue.
